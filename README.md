# Python-Text-Editor
A simple notepad-like text editor built with tkinter that's still in the works. 

### Features:
1. **Fonts - > Helvetica, Times New Roman, Courier**
2. **Save**
3. Classic **Cut, Copy, Paste**
4. Can open existing .txt files

### Bugs:
1. Exiting the file doesn't prompt a warning to save the file if the file is not saved


### Big Features I plan on implementing
1. A File Manager
2. Support for .html, .php, .py, .sh, .java files with syntax highlighting

### Where is this going to go?
Well, I do want a personal text editor but mainly this is a learning oppurtunity to build something fun that is also a long-term project which will grow with me.
